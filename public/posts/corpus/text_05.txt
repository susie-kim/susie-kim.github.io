Boxing is one of the most popular sports of this era, it is almost one of the most deadly. During a fight a boxer may receive several hundred punches to the head, and each time that he gets punched he looses more and more brain cells.
The brain is encased in the skull, but not only in the skull is the brain but also a liquid 'shock-absorber' to protect the rain. Even though there is the protective liquid the brain still gets bounced about against the skull, damaging it more and more every time. So, a boxer who has been boxing for a number of years, ten for example, and retires is very likely to have brain damage and it could be very severe or hardly noticable but the damage is still there. Getting away from the long term effects to the short term effects, yes brain cells are still being killed but when a boxer receives a very strong punch direct to the face not only would it damage his nose, eyes, teeth and general facial features but it could also cause him to enter a coma, haemorage or die.
Another aspect that many people are quite opposed to is the absolutely huge salaries that top rank boxers receive. The question that people have is: is that person really worth several million pounds? Just for a fight against another top ranking boxer that may only last a couple of rounds. Another adaptation of cost is the cost of having so many medical units and doctors at the fight when they could be somewhere else, more important, where people aren't getting paid to fight.
The major influence keeping boxing going is all the people around the world who enjoy watching the sport, there is an incredibly big demand for it. Boxing is one of the most popular sports, and it will be difficult to ban it. Not only does it satisfy the viewers but a lot of companies also sponsor boxing which brings a lot of advertisement and capital for them.
