title: About
---

I am an applied linguist and language teacher, currently working as a Lecturer in Korean Language for the Department of East Asian Studies at Princeton University.

My main research interest sits at an intersection of language assessment, second language writing, language proficiency standards (e.g., CEFR, ACTFL), and corpus-based methods. I have primarily focused on investigating linguistic characteristics and textual features of second language (L2) English at various proficiency levels. Recently I have been working building and analyzing Korean language corpora and related tools for teaching purposes.

I have a wide range of personal interests and, though amateur, enjoy: photography, cooking, Major League Baseball and statistics, and programming.

On this website, I share some research tools and methods as I work through them for my academic projects or personal enjoyment. Feel free to explore, leave comments, and/or contact me!
