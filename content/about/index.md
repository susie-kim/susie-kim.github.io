Hello! My name is Susie Kim and I am an applied linguist and a language teacher. My current position is a Lecturer in Korean Language for the [Department of East Asian Studies](https://eas.princeton.edu) at Princeton University.

My main academic interest sits at an intersection of language assessment, second language writing, and corpus-based methods. I have primarily focused on investigating linguistic characteristics and textual features of second language writing at various proficiency levels. More recently, I have been working on building and analyzing Korean language corpora and related tools for teaching purposes.

Photography is something I have always enjoyed in my life so I [post them here](https://susiekim.work/photos/) sometimes. I feel lucky to have had experiences in a darkroom from high school to college but now I'm most interested in long-exposure photography of nature and the night sky. 

On this website, I share some research tools and methods as I work through them for my academic projects or personal enjoyment. Please feel free to explore the contents and contact me!
