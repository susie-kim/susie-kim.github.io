title: About

My name is Susie Kim and I am an applied linguist and language teacher. My current position is a Lecturer in Korean Language for the Department of East Asian Studies at Princeton University.

My main academic interest sits at an intersection of language assessment, second language writing, and corpus-based methods. I have primarily focused on investigating linguistic characteristics and textual features of second language (L2) English at various proficiency levels. Recently, I have been working on building and analyzing Korean language corpora and related tools for teaching purposes.

I have a wide range of personal interests and, though amateur, enjoy: photography, cooking, and programming.

On this website, I share some research tools and methods as I work through them for my academic projects or personal enjoyment. Please feel free to explore the contacts and contact me!
